## Links that helped me out, i hope it can be useful for you :D

## Week 00

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)<br> A simple and straightforward reference for markdown syntax. This is where I learn to write this page.

## Week 01
* [Vi Editor Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm)<br> Provides clear explanation on how to use the vi editor, the most important one for me is how to get out of vi. The website gives each command an explanation and description.

* [Linux Basic Commands](https://www.hostinger.co.id/tutorial/perintah-dasar-linux)<br> All you need to know about basic linux commands is here. This website gives you explanation about when, why, and how to use linux commands. I was pretty confused about ls, pwd, cd, and cat and this website saved me.

* [Git Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) <br> A quick watch to know about git. The video gives clear and exceptionally simple tutorial. I like how the video is straight to the point and can put so many important information on such a short time.

* [AWK Commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/) <br> The website gives clear explanation of awk commands. Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. I like how the website provides a sample output for each awk command.

* [Regex Cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) <br> A quick reference guide for regular expressions (regex).


## Week 02
 
* [SHA-256 Algorithm](https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption) <br> What is SHA-256? SHA-256 is a patented cryptographic hash function that outputs a value that is 256 bits long. SHA-256 is one of the most secure hashing functions on the market.

* [How SHA-256 Works](https://qvault.io/cryptography/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/) <br> I was wondering how can my txt files consisting of strings can be turned into a scramble of alphabets and numbers, such as ABH28523KSB. That was the work of SHA-256 algorithm. This website gives a really clear step by step process how SHA-256 works, it will show you how it can turns "hello world' into an unintelligible text. 

* [C For Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/) <br> A really nice and easy to understand introduction to C programming. This website will give you a well-rounded overview of the language.
