# Links
 
Links that helped me out, maybe it can be useful for you :D

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), a simple and straightforward reference for markdown syntax. This is where I learn to write this page.

* [Vi Editor Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm), provides clear explanation on how to use the vi editor.                                            
How I edit my text file: vi something.txt -> press i to enter insert mode -> do some changes that are needed -> press esc to go back into command mode -> type :wq or ZZ to exit

* [Linux Basic Commands](https://www.hostinger.co.id/tutorial/perintah-dasar-linux), all you need to know about basic linux commands is here. This website gives you explanation about when, why, and how to use linux commands. I was pretty confused about ls, pwd, cd, and cat and this website saved me.

* [Git Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE), a quick watch to know about git. The video gives clear and exceptionally simple tutorial. I like how the video is straight to the point and can put some many important information on such a short time.

* Soon!
