## Links that helped me out, i hope it can be useful for you :D

## Week 00

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)<br> A simple and straightforward reference for markdown syntax. This is where I learn to write this page.

## Week 01
* [Vi Editor Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm)<br> Provides clear explanation on how to use the vi editor, the most important one for me is how to get out of vi. The website gives each command an explanation and description.

* [Linux Basic Commands](https://www.hostinger.co.id/tutorial/perintah-dasar-linux)<br> All you need to know about basic linux commands is here. This website gives you explanation about when, why, and how to use linux commands. I was pretty confused about ls, pwd, cd, and cat and this website saved me.

* [Git Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) <br> A quick watch to know about git. The video gives clear and exceptionally simple tutorial. I like how the video is straight to the point and can put so many important information on such a short time.

## Week 02
* Soon!
